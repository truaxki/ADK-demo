- [ ] Core Astra agent implementation - 50% 
- [ ] Travel Concierge sub-agent - 20%
- [ ] Documentation - 60%
- [ ] Testing framework - 10%
- [ ] Deployment pipeline - 0%

## Agent Implementation Status

### Astra (Coordinator Agent)
- [x] Basic prompt design
- [x] Agent configuration
- [ ] Tool integration
- [ ] Sub-agent routing logic
- [ ] User preference handling
- [ ] Conversation memory implementation

### Travel Concierge
- [x] Basic prompt design
- [ ] Agent configuration
- [ ] API integrations (Maps, Flights, Hotels)
- [ ] Sub-agent development:
  - [ ] Inspiration agent
  - [ ] Planning agent 
  - [ ] Booking agent

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Current)
- Complete architecture documentation
- Implement core Astra agent
- Set up development environment
- Create basic testing framework

### Phase 2: First Specialist Agent
- Implement Travel Concierge agent
- Integrate with necessary APIs
- Develop sub-agents (Inspiration, Planning, Booking)
- Test with real user scenarios

### Phase 3: Additional Capabilities
- Add more specialist agents:
  - [ ] Productivity agent
  - [ ] Research assistant
  - [ ] Code helper
- Enhance existing agent capabilities
- Improve agent coordination

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Performance optimization
- Security audits
- Deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and logging

## Open Issues & Challenges

1. **Agent coordination**: Determining the best way for agents to coordinate
2. **Memory management**: Efficiently managing conversation context across agents
3. **API integration**: Standardizing external service connections
4. **Output consistency**: Ensuring consistent user experience across agents
5. **Evaluation metrics**: Defining success metrics for agent performance

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2025-01-16 | Simplified folder structure | Cleaner hierarchy, less nesting | Dedicated "subagents" folder |
| 2025-01-15 | Use folder-based structure for agents | Clear organization, follows ADK patterns | Flat structure, service-based |
| 2025-01-15 | Gemini-2.0-flash as default model | Good balance of performance/cost | GPT-4, Claude |
| 2025-01-15 | Hierarchical agent system | Better specialization and modularity | Flat multi-agent system |

## Meeting Notes
*(Latest at the top)*

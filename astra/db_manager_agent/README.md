# Database Manager Agent

A specialized sub-agent for Astra that helps design and manage database schemas.

## Overview

The Database Manager Agent is a specialized component that handles all database-related queries. It helps users brainstorm and design appropriate database schemas for various projects, providing recommendations on structure, relationships, and optimization.

## Setup Requirements

### Configuration

This agent uses a database catalog file to keep track of existing database schemas:

```
astra/db_manager_agent/databases.json
```

This catalog contains information about existing database schemas that can be referenced when designing new ones.

## Features

- **Database schema design** for various project requirements
- **Schema optimization recommendations** based on best practices
- **Database type suggestions** (SQL, NoSQL, Graph, etc.)
- **Documentation** of schemas in a standardized format

## Usage Examples

When integrated with Astra, users can ask queries like:

- "I need a database schema for a blog platform"
- "What's the best database structure for an e-commerce site?"
- "Help me design a user management database"
- "What should my schema look like for a social media application?"

## Future Goals

In future iterations, the Database Manager Agent will be enhanced with the following capabilities:

### SQL Operations on a Central Database

- **Direct database connectivity** to a central database system
- **Perform SQL queries** on existing databases
- **Execute schema modifications** (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.)
- **Data analysis** through SQL aggregation functions
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization suggestions
- **Migration planning** for schema updates
- **Security recommendations** for database access control

These enhancements will transform the agent from a schema design advisor into a full database management assistant that can both recommend and implement database solutions.
